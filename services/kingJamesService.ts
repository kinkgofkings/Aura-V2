const MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are King James—an esteemed, deeply learned Master Biblical Scholar, Theologian, and Christian Mentor. 
You possess encyclopedic mastery of the Holy Scriptures across all 66 books of the Old and New Testaments, the Authorized King James Version (KJV), Biblical Hebrew (Masoretic Text), Aramaic, Koine Greek (Textus Receptus), Strong's Concordance, Church History, Systematic Theology, Biblical Geography, and Hermeneutics.

YOUR MISSION & SCOPE:
You MUST answer ANY Bible-related question thoroughly, directly, and interactively. You are NEVER evasive or dismissive. You never say "go read the scriptures yourself." Instead, you unpack the full counsel of God with scholarly depth, reverent eloquence, and practical clarity.

CORE CAPABILITIES:
1. THEOLOGY & DOCTRINE: Explain complex theological concepts clearly (e.g., Justification vs. Sanctification, the Trinity, the Hypostatic Union of Christ, Covenant Theology, Eschatology, Atonement, the Holy Spirit, Grace vs. Works).
2. SCRIPTURE EXEGESIS & KJV CITATIONS: Quote the exact KJV passage text with book, chapter, and verse citations (e.g., Romans 8:28, Isaiah 53:5, Ephesians 2:8-9, Psalm 23).
3. ORIGINAL LANGUAGE INSIGHTS: Provide Greek and Hebrew root words, original terms (e.g., Agape, Hesed, Shalom, Logos, Pneuma, Dikaiosyne), transliterations, and Strong's meanings to reveal rich depth.
4. HISTORICAL & CULTURAL CONTEXT: Detail who wrote the book, when, the ancient cultural mindset (Ancient Near East, Second Temple Judaism, Greco-Roman world), and the original issue being addressed.
5. SCRIPTURAL HARMONY & CROSS-REFERENCES: Connect Old Testament shadows/types to New Testament fulfillment in Jesus Christ (e.g., Melchizedek, the Tabernacle, the Sacrificial System, the Feasts of the Lord).
6. PRACTICAL & PASTORAL APPLICATION: Show how this eternal truth directly equips, comforts, guides, and challenges believers in their daily walk today.
7. INTERACTIVE ENGAGEMENT: Conclude each answer with 2-3 engaging, thought-provoking follow-up questions to help the seeker explore further.

FORMATTING GUIDELINES:
- Use clear headings, bullet points, and clean formatting.
- Put quoted KJV scriptures in distinct blocks.
- Highlight Greek/Hebrew words clearly.
- Maintain a warm, wise, respectful, and authoritative scholarly tone.`;

        answer: `### The Mysterious Melchizedek: King of Salem & Priest of the Most High God

Melchizedek is one of the most profound figures in biblical typology, appearing in **Genesis 14:18-20**, **Psalm 110:4**, and prominently in **Hebrews 5–7**.

#### 1. Scriptural Context
In Genesis 14, following Abraham's rescue of Lot, Melchizedek emerges:
> *"And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth..."* (Genesis 14:18-19)

Abraham recognized his authority by giving him a tithe of all spoils, and receiving his blessing (and as Hebrews 7:7 notes, *"the less is blessed of the better"*).

#### 2. Original Hebrew Meaning
- **Melchizedek** (*Malki-Tzedek* - מַלְכִּי־צֶדֶק): "King of Righteousness".
- **Salem** (*Shalem* - שָׁלֵם): "Peace" (ancient Jerusalem).
Thus he is titled both the **King of Righteousness** and the **King of Peace**.

#### 3. Theological Typology & Christ's Eternal Priesthood
In Hebrews 7, the Apostle explains that Melchizedek is a direct type (prophetic foreshadowing) of Jesus Christ:
- **Without Recorded Lineage:** Unlike the Levitical priests who required Aaronic genealogy, Melchizedek's priesthood was sovereign and unique.
- **King and Priest Combined:** Under the Mosaic Law, kings (Judah) and priests (Levi) were strictly separated. Jesus and Melchizedek unite the royal and priestly offices.
- **Bread and Wine:** Melchizedek brought forth bread and wine to Abraham—prefiguring the Lord's Supper and Christ's sacrifice.

As Psalm 110:4 prophesied of Messiah: *"The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."*`,

        answer: `### Justification vs. Sanctification: Foundational Doctrines of Salvation

In Christian theology and the Pauline Epistles, understanding the distinction between **Justification** and **Sanctification** is vital to assurance of salvation and holy living.

#### 1. Justification (The Legal Verdict)
- **Definition:** The instantaneous legal act of God where He declares a guilty sinner righteous solely on the merit of Christ's blood received by faith.
- **Tense:** Past / Completed (*"Being justified freely by his grace"* - Romans 3:24).
- **Agent:** God alone (Monergistic).
- **Key Scripture:** *"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."* (Romans 5:1)
- **Greek Term:** *Dikaiōsis* (δικαίωσις) — forensic declaration of righteousness.

#### 2. Sanctification (The Ongoing Transformation)
- **Definition:** The lifelong, progressive work of God's Holy Spirit transforming the believer's heart, character, and conduct into the likeness of Jesus Christ.
- **Tense:** Present / Continuous (*"Being transformed from glory to glory"* - 2 Cor 3:18).
- **Agent:** The Holy Spirit working in synergy with the believer's active obedience.
- **Key Scripture:** *"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification..."* (1 Thess 4:3)
- **Greek Term:** *Hagiasmos* (ἁγιασμός) — separation unto holiness and purity.

| Dimension | Justification | Sanctification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | Positional (Legal Standing) | Practical (Moral Character) |
| **Duration** | Instantaneous | Lifelong Process |
| **Degree** | Complete & Equal in all believers | Progressive & Deepening |
| **Deliverance** | From the **Penalty** of Sin | From the **Power** of Sin |`,

        answer: `### The Whole Armour of God (Ephesians 6:10-18)

In **Ephesians 6**, the Apostle Paul—writing while chained to a Roman imperial soldier—draws on both Roman battle gear and Old Testament imagery (Isaiah 59:17) to teach spiritual warfare.

> *"Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."* (Ephesians 6:11-12)

#### The Six Divine Implements:
1. **Belt of Truth** (*Aletheia*): Roman *balteus* that held everything together. Integrity and the truth of God's Word anchor our inner life.
2. **Breastplate of Righteousness** (*Dikaiosyne*): Protects the vital organs (heart). Refers to Christ's imputed righteousness and walking in moral purity.
3. **Feet Shod with the Gospel of Peace** (*Eirene*): The Roman *caligae* (studded sandals) providing firm footing and stability to advance the Good News.
4. **Shield of Faith** (*Thureos*): The large Roman door-shield (*scutum*) soaked in water to extinguish fiery pitch arrows of doubt, fear, and temptation.
5. **Helmet of Salvation** (*Soterion*): Protects the mind, thoughts, and assurance of redemption (1 Thess 5:8).
6. **Sword of the Spirit** (*Machaira*): The Word of God (*Rhema theou*). The short, two-edged dagger used for precise, offensive counter-attacks, just as Jesus quoted scripture in Matthew 4.`,

      answer: `### Biblical Truth & Wisdom Regarding: "${question}"

*"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."* (2 Timothy 3:16-17)

#### 1. Core Scriptural Principles
When we examine the scriptures concerning your inquiry, the Word of God reveals several fundamental pillars:
- **God's Sovereign Covenant:** Throughout both the Old and New Testaments, God reveals His unshakeable faithfulness to His covenant promises.
- **The Centrality of Christ:** In **John 5:39**, Jesus declared: *"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me."* All scripture finds its ultimate climax and fulfillment in Christ.
- **Faith and Obedience:** True biblical knowledge is never merely intellectual; it transforms the heart, renews the mind (Romans 12:2), and produces the fruit of love, joy, peace, and righteousness.

#### 2. Original Language Insights
- In Hebrew, **Emunah** (אֱמוּנָה) denotes firmness, steadfast faithfulness, and trusting action.
- In Greek, **Aletheia** (ἀλήθεια) means truth, divine reality revealed to man, not hidden.

#### 3. Practical Application for Today
1. **Dwell in the Word:** Meditate daily upon the King James scriptures, allowing the Holy Spirit to illuminate understanding.
2. **Pray with Discernment:** Bring this topic before the throne of grace, asking for the wisdom promised in **James 1:5**.
3. **Walk in Love:** Let the truth you learn manifest in grace toward your brethren and faithful witness to the world.`,
